Description: Facilitates the exploration of variation and patterns within 
    fisheries data (Year, Catch, Effort, depth, vessel, etc), especially yearly 
    patterns. It also includes
    functions to produce sketch maps of fisheries data where Lat and Long data,
    or other spatially explicit data, are available. Finally, there are 
    functions for conducting different types of CPUE standardization that are 
    there to act simply as a guide to what is possible.
    Version 0.0.4 fixes minor bugs
    Version 0.0.5 alters plotLand to include the option of using rgb colours.
    This would allow for transparency in case you want to illustrate 
    distributions on land or in rivers.
