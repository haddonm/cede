An R package to assist with CPUE standardization and data exploration

This package was devised to support an array of data-poor stock assessment workshops run as part of FRDC project 2017/102: Reducing the Number of Undefined Spe-cies in Future Status of Australian Fish Stocks Reports: Phase Two - training in the assessment of data-poor stocks.


2023 Update. Previously the function _getfact_ used an appraoch that was deprecated after the advent of R4.0.0. This is now amended and everything appears to work as it should. Do contact me if anything appears amiss: malcolm.haddon@gmail.com
